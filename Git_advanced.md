## Stashing
    Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a 
    bit to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to 
    this point later. The answer to this issue is the git stash command.
